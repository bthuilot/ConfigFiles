A shuffle button for Netflix TV shows.

To operate, simply navigate to a show on Netflix (e.g. <a href="https://www.netflix.com/title/70153404">Friends</a>, and click the button. A random episode will play.

Included is support for 87 shows. The extension will silently fail if it's on a show it does not recognize, but I am adding shows all the time. If there's a show you would like support for, send me a note and I'll add it in the next release.
